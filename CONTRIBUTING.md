Welcome to the CommunAl Community!
MAPle is a part of the CommunAl toolkit for analysis of microbial communities. As such, we want to have a thriving and friendly community ourselves.

 - Steps for creating good issues or pull requests:
      There are templates for issues/bugs, feature requests and "unidentified other issues". Please do use them.
      Pull requests are always welcome. As I am just one human, it might take a while for me to react to your requests. I am not ignoring
      anyone, I am probably just busy. Or on holiday.

 - Community and behavioral expectations:
      We do have a very general code of conduct. Additional to that I just ask everyone to be friendly and welcoming.
      Factual and friendly critique and comments will always be met with a large will to solve any issues. 
      Be aware that this is academic software - it is not perfectly adhering to industry standards or to any standards in general. 
      It might not always work for you, but that is what bug reports and feature requests are for.
      On the other hand there is direct developer support available and any exchange of ideas is welcome.
